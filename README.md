##Checking package.json DevDependencies:

    "devDependencies": {
        "css-loader": "^5.2.6",
        "eslint": "^7.28.0",
        "eslint-plugin-inclusive-language": "^2.1.1",

    }


###The sample webpack.config.js:
https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-example-projects/blob/master/webpack/webpack.config.js

From that, I extracted following bits. 

```
const path = require('path')
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin')

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          { loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader },
          { loader: 'css-loader', options: { importLoaders: 1 } }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'main.css'
    })
  ]
}
```

>> Add above to the lwc-services.config.js, it becomes:

```
// Find the full example of all available configuration options at
// https://github.com/muenzpraeger/create-lwc-app/blob/main/packages/lwc-services/example/lwc-services.config.js

const path = require('path')
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin')

module.exports = {
    resources: [{ from: 'src/resources/', to: 'dist/resources/' }],
    module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: /\.css$/,
            use: [
              { loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader },
              { loader: 'css-loader', options: { importLoaders: 1 } }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      plugins: [
        new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
          filename: 'main.css'
        })
      ]
};
